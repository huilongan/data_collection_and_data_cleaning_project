Overview

This project is going to demonstrate data cleaning techniques.The dataset used can be found via http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.


Making Modifications to This Script

Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you will need to make one modification to the R file before you can process the data. All the setwd() or list.files or list.dirs commands might need to be modified before you use this code.

Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
